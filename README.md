        A user logs in as an admin or as a normal user.
        The admin has special privilegs.
	The admin is the only user who can generate reports and add users.
	All other functionalities can be accessed by normal users.

### How is the a user created?

    The admin has to login and their credentials are verified.
    The admin is presented with a menu that includes this option.
    The necessary details are entered and a user is created.

### How is a task added?


   Any user can add a task after logging in, selecting and giving inputs the option via prompts.

### How is the task viewed?
